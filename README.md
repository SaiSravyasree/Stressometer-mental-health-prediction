# Stressometer
- In today's fast-paced world, stress is often referred to as the cancer of the mind, significantly impacting a student's ability to focus on academics and responsibilities.  
- Factors contributing to student stress include parental expectations, peer pressure, health concerns, and financial difficulties. The COVID-19 pandemic has further intensified these challenges.  
- Despite growing awareness, automation for student stress prediction in educational institutions remains minimal.  
- To address this, we developed a software solution integrated with a Machine Learning algorithm to predict student stress levels and update the results on an admin dashboard.  
- The admin (Teacher/Administration) can track and monitor students' stress levels effectively.  

## Objectives:
- To monitor students' mental health regularly.  
- To provide valuable insights and resources to help manage stress.  
- To offer solutions for coping with academic pressure and mental health concerns.
